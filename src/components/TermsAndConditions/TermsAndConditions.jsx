							<strong>The MyBit Tokens</strong>
							(also referred to as MyB) <strong>are assets that are subject to significant risks and therefore not suitable for all purchasers</strong>.
							Each prospective purchaser should (i) have <strong>sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the MyB</strong>,
							the merits and <strong>risks of purchasing MyB</strong> and the information contained in these Terms; (ii) have access to, and knowledge of,
							appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of the purchaser's particular financial situation, a purchase of MyB and the
							<strong>risk to loose the entire amount designated to purchase MyB (see in particular Sections 5 and 18 of these Terms)</strong>;
							(iii) have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of purchasing and holding of MyB and (iv) be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of an adviser) possible scenarios for economic, technological and other factors that may affect the purchaser's holding of MyB and the risks relating to such purchase/holding.
						</p>
						<p>
							Before acquiring any MyB, each prospective purchaser should have understood the Terms and be familiar with them, the MyBit Platform, the MyBit Project and the MyBit Foundation. By participating in the sale of MyB, you expressly acknowledge and represent that you have carefully reviewed the Terms and fully understand the risks, costs, and benefits of purchasing MyB and agree to be bound by these Terms.

									<li>
										<p>
											The following terms and conditions (<strong>Terms</strong>) govern the sale (<strong>MyBit Token Sale</strong>)
											of the cryptographic fuel – the <strong>MyBit Tokens (MyB)</strong> –
											that is required to run distributed applications and may only be used on the MyBit platform (<strong>MyBit Platform</strong>)
											to purchasers of MyB (<strong>Purchasers</strong> collectively and <strong>Purchaser</strong> individually).
											The MyBit Token Sale is conducted by the MyBit Foundation in formation (<i>MyBit Stiftung</i>, <strong>MyBit Foundation (Seller)</strong>).
										</p>
										<p>
											<strong>
												This document is not a solicitation for investment and does not pertain in any way to an offering of securities in any jurisdiction.
											</strong>
										</p>
										<p>
											MyBit Tokens are <strong>exclusively offered for sale to Swiss residents</strong>
											(whose citizenship does not preclude them from a purchase). If a Purchaser is a citizen, tax resident,
											green card holder or equivalent <strong>of a country other than Switzerland</strong>,
											in particular the United States of America, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, Australia
											or a member state of the European Union or the EEA, <strong>he or she shall <i>not</i> participate in the MyBit Token Sale</strong>.
											By participating in the sale of MyB, you expressly acknowledge and represent that you have <strong>carefully reviewed the Terms</strong> and fully understand the risks, costs, and benefits of purchasing MyB and agree to be bound by these Terms.
										</p>
										<p>
											As set forth further below, you further represent and warrant that, to the extent permitted by law,
											that you are authorized to purchase MyB, are of a legal age to be bound by these Terms, and will not hold the Seller,
											MyBit AG (<strong>MyBit Ltd</strong>), any of their affiliates, officers, directors, agents, joint ventures,
											employees, advisors, attorneys and suppliers, now or in the future and any other member of the MyBit Team
											(collectively the <strong>MyBit Parties</strong>) liable for any losses or any special, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of, or in any way connected to the sale of MyB.
										</p>
										<p>
											<strong>
												Only these Terms apply to the MyBit Token Sale. All other sources of information, including but not limited to any whitepapers and the like shall neither be binding nor taken into account when considering purchasing MyBit Tokens.
											</strong>
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											The MyBit Platform is being developed by a volunteer contributor team and will continue to be developed on a volunteer basis by some
											developers as well as under a more formalized contracting or employment relationship for other developers. The group of developers and
											other personnel that is now, or will be, employed by, or contracted with MyBit Ltd and/or the MyBit Foundation, which both are currently
											being established, is termed the <strong>MyBit Team</strong>.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											As described further below, distributed applications on the MyBit Platform require MyBit Tokens. In order not to create unnecessary entry barriers, it is intended, to the extent technically feasible and permitted under any applicable laws and regulations, to accept various means of payment (both, fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies) to settle transaction fees on the MyBit Platform (it being understood that, on the back-end, computational steps will still require MyBit Tokens to fuel the operations).
										</p>
										<p>
											Furthermore, by means of a smart contract, all transactions on the MyBit Platform will automatically be assessed a 1% network fee which will, by smart contract, be distributed to Purchasers and other MyBit Token holders in relation to their percentage stake that they have in MyBit Tokens.
										</p>
										<p>
											<strong>
												It is to be noted that ownership of MyBit Tokens gives no right or claim express or implied to receive any fee, profit and/or revenue share, be it against the Seller or any other person or legal entity.
											</strong>
										</p>
										<p>
											As of today, it remains unclear whether the MyBit Platform will ever be fully functional and whether there will ever be operations carried out on the MyBit Platform. Hence, it is unclear as to whether the MyBit Token will ever become functional and/or as to whether any revenues will be distributed to MyBit Token holders. Any Purchasers should therefore carefully consider the significant risk to loose the entire amount used to purchase MyBit Tokens (see in particular Sections 5 and 18 of these Terms).
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											Parties may be interested in purchasing MyB (the cryptofuel) in the MyBit Token Sale to power distributed application services on the MyBit Platform or to support the development of the MyBit Platform.
										</p>
										<p>
											<strong>
												It is to be noted, though, that MyBit Tokens may only be used on the MyBit Platform for specific applications provided on this platform. It is therefore no currency or money, be it fiat or not.
											</strong>
										</p>
										<p>
											<strong>
												Individuals, businesses, and other organizations should carefully weigh the risks, costs, and benefits of acquiring the cryptofuel early in the MyBit Token Sale versus waiting to purchase MyBit Tokens once the system is operational and when they or their businesses actually require the cryptofuel to operate.
											</strong>
										</p>
									</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								<div className="heading">WARNING: MYBIT TOKENS ARE OF A NON-FINANCIAL NATURE</div>
								<ol>
									<li>
										<p>
											Being merely the virtual fuel for running the MyBit Platform, by nature MyBit Tokens

											<strong>are not and shall in no case be understood, deemed, interpreted or construed as:</strong>
										</p>
										<ul className="ul_letter">
											<li>any kind of currency or money, whether fiat or not;</li>
											<li>equity interest, voting or non-voting securities (or its like) in, or claims against, the Seller or any other entity or person in any jurisdiction;</li>
											<li>equity or debt investment of any kind in any venture;</li>
											<li>any securities having intrinsic value or market price;</li>
											<li>any form of financial derivatives;</li>
											<li>any commercial paper or negotiable instrument;</li>
											<li>any form of investment contract between the relevant holder and any other person;</li>
											<li>any commodity or asset that any person is obliged to redeem or purchase; or</li>
											<li>any note, bond, warrant or other certificate that entitles the to interest, dividend or any kind of return from any person.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										Ownership of MyB carries <strong>no rights express or implied</strong>. Purchases of MyB are <strong>non-refundable</strong>.
										Purchasers should have <strong>no expectation of influence over governance of the MyBit Platform</strong>, the MyBit Ltd, the MyBit Foundation or any of the MyBit Parties or any other part of the MyBit project.
									</li>
									<li>
										MyB is not, and is not intended and/or expected to become, a crypto currency. In particular, MyB (i) cannot be, and are not meant to be exchanged for goods or services (other than on the MyBit Platform) and (ii) has no known uses and is not intended to have any use outside the contemplated MyBit Platform. The Seller takes no responsibility that the MyBit can, now or in the future, be acquired, sold or traded on any known exchange or similar platform.
									</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								<div className="heading">
									WARNING: DO NOT PURCHASE MYBIT TOKENS IF YOU ARE NOT AN EXPERT IN DEALING WITH CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS AND BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SOFTWARE SYSTEMS
								</div>
								<ol>
									<li>
										<p>
											Purchases of MyB, the MyBit Platform’s cryptofuel, should be undertaken only by individuals, entities, or companies that have significant experience with, and understanding of, the usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens and blockchain-based software systems.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											While the MyBit Team will provide general guidelines for user usage and storage of MyB before the MyBit Platform becomes operational, Purchasers should have functional understanding of storage and transmission mechanisms associated with other cryptographic tokens. While the MyBit Team will be available to assist Purchasers of MyB during and after the sale, the Seller will not be responsible for lost MyB resulting from actions taken by, or omitted by Purchasers. Note, in particular, that MyB Purchasers should take great care to write down their wallet password and not lose it so as to be sure that they will be able to access their MyB when it becomes available after the MyBit Token Sale.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											If you do not have such experience or expertise, then you should not purchase MyB or participate in the sale of MyB.
										</p>

							</li>
							<li>
								<div className="heading">WARNING: CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS OF VALUE MAY EXPERIENCE EXTREME VOLATILITY IN PRICING</div>
								<ol>
									<li>
										<p>
											Cryptographic tokens that have been assigned a certain value in public markets, such as bitcoin (<strong>BTC</strong>) or Ether, just to name two well known tokens with – contrary to MyB – a currency function, have demonstrated extreme fluctuations in price over short periods of time on a regular basis, in particular sharp losses of value within a very short period of time. A Purchaser of MyB should be prepared to expect similar or even bigger fluctuations, both down and up, in the price of MyB, in particular in view of the limited purpose of MyB as cryptographic fuel. Such fluctuations are due to market forces and represent changes in the balance of supply and demand. The Seller cannot and does not guarantee any functioning market or any liquidity for MyB and therefore there may be periods of time in which it will be difficult or impossible to buy or sell MyB or to exchange it into other assets, be it other cryptographic fuels, a cryptocurrency such as BTC or other (physical or digital) assets. Additionally, due to different regulatory dictates in different jurisdictions and the inability of citizens of certain countries to open accounts at exchanges located elsewhere in the world, the possibility to use, buy sell or trade MyB may be significantly different in different countries and this would likely be reflected in significant price discrepancies.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											By purchasing MyB, you expressly acknowledge and represent that you fully understand that MyB may experience volatility in pricing and will not seek to hold any of the MyBit Parties liable for any losses or any special, incidental, or consequential damages arising from, or in any way connected to the sale of MyB.

							<li>
								<div className="heading">WARNING: THE PURCHASE OF MYBIT TOKENS IS EXTREMELY RISKY</div>
								<ol>
									<li>
										<p>
											The purchase of MyB carries with it a number of risks. The following list is not exhaustive, and potential purchasers should, prior to purchasing MyB, inter alia, carefully consider the more detailed description of the risks listed below in Section18 and, to the extent necessary, consult an appropriate lawyer, accountant, or tax professional. If any of the following risks are unacceptable to you, you should not purchase MyB.

											By purchasing MyB, and to the extent permitted by law, you are agreeing not to hold any of the MyBit Parties liable for any losses or any special, incidental, or consequential damages arising from, or in any way connected, to the sale of MyB, including losses associated with the risks set forth below.

							<li>
								<div className="heading">What is the MyBit platform?</div>
								<ol>
									<li>
										<p>
											The MyBit Platform is designed to connect investors with individuals seeking financing for specific projects (<strong>MyBit Projects</strong>). Since it relies on smart contract technology it’s main intended benefit is the ability to connect investors directly with individuals without the need for a broker, money transmitter or other form of intermediary.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											Payouts for MyBit Projects (dividends, revenue sharing, etc.) shall also be governed and executed directly by the smart contracts so a third-party service is not needed to determine, process and/or settle payments to investors.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											The MyBit Platform is, to the extent technically feasible and permissible under any applicable laws and regulations, intended to be deployed initially for financing renewable energy infrastructure (i.e. at home solar panels), but might be applied across many businesses later on.
										</p>
									</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								<div className="heading">MyBit Token Sale</div>
								<ol>
									<li>
										<p>
											A limited amount of three (3) million MyBit Tokens (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the pre-sold MyB,
											see Section 8 hereinafter, which have been pre-sold at a discount) shall be available for sale for a maximum period
											of up to 30 calendar day, or until all three million MyB have been sold (the <strong>Token Sale Period</strong>)).
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											Purchasers in the MyBit Token Sale will acquire MyB at predefined sale prices in exchange for Ether as follows
										</p>
										<ul className="ul_letter">
											<li>
												In respect of the <strong>first 9,375 Ether transferred to the Etherum Smart Contract, the Etherum Smart Contract</strong>
												will mint 133 MyB per Ether (i.e. <strong>one (1) Ether equals 133 MyB</strong>);
											</li>
											<li>
												In respect of the remaining 17,500 Ether sent to the Etherum Smart Contract, the Etherum Smart Contract will mint 100 MyB per Ether
												(i.e <strong>one (1) Ether equals 100 MyB</strong>).
											</li>
										</ul>
										<p>
											<strong>
												Purchasers should note the first tranche of 1,246,875 MyB in the equivalent of 9,375
												Ether includes any MyB sold in the Previous MyBit Token Sale (as defined in section 8 hereinafter).
											</strong>

											Hence, if and to the extent that the purchasers who were offered to participate in the Previous MyBit Token Sale elect to contribute an aggregate of up to 9,375 Ether in the ongoing Previous MyBit Token Sale, purchasers acquiring MyB hereunder may only be able to acquire 100 MyB per Ether.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											In order to purchase MyBit Tokens, two options shall be available to Purchasers.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											Purchasers may <strong>transfer Ether from an ERC20 compliant wallet</strong> to an Ethereum Smart Contract address,
											such address being posted on an easy to use Dashboard on the MyBit website.
											The Etherum Smart Contract mints the MyB instantly and sends them back to the Purchasers’ <strong>ERC20 compliant wallet</strong>.
											Thereby, MyB will be created on an as-ordered basis for the MyBit Token Sale.
											<strong>
												Purchasers should be aware that participation in the MyBit Token Sale by contribution of Ether to the Etherum Smart Contract is only possible from an ERC20 compliant wallet. Other wallets will not accept / be able to store the MyBit Tokens sent to such wallet by the Etherum Smart Contract.
											</strong>
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											<strong>
												Purchasers who wish to acquire MyBit Tokens in exchange for the cryptocurrencies Bitcoin, DASH, REP, ETC or Mondero may acquire MyBit Tokens by following the Changelly API link:
											</strong>
										</p>
										<p>
											Changelly will exchange such cryptocurrencies for Ether (at the prices offered by Changelly, as changed from time to time) and send such Ether to an Etherum Smart Contract operated by MyBit. The Etherum Smart Contract mints the MyB and such MyB will be stored with MyBit until the MyBit Token Sale has been completed. Only once the MyBit Token Sale has been completed, the MyB will be allocated by the Seller and Changelly to the respective Purchasers. Purchasers acquiring MyB via Changelly should note that:
										</p>
										<ul className="ul_letter">
											<li>
												the Purchaser is exposed to the counterparty risk of Changelly and neither the Seller nor any other MyBit Party may be held liable for any loss and/or wrongdoing caused by Changelly;
											</li>
											<li>
												the MyB minted for Purchasers will only be made available to the Purchasers within
												<strong>
													72hours after completion of the Token Sale Period. Hence, the Purchasers acquiring MyB Tokens by following the Changelly API will not receive access to the MyB minted by the Etherum Smart Contract before that.
												</strong>
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											As the MyBit Platform is not yet functional, the <strong>MyB might have to be exchanged in order to be compatible with the MyBit Platform currently being developed</strong>. In such case, the MyB will be redeemed in the future on a 1 to 1 basis (or equal/proportionate amount if the total supply of MyB Tokens shall be changed in the future for any reason, as the Seller may think fit) for the actual MyBit network token necessary to fuel the operations on the MyBit Platform once fully developed.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											The Ether sent to the Etherum Smart Contract as consideration for the MyBit Tokens are transferred to an escrow wallet with a multi-signature mechanism (<strong>Multisig Escrow Wallet</strong>).
											The Multisig Escrow Wallet shall be under control of two members of Seller’s board of trustees (Stiftungsrat),
											in particular Ian Worrall and Thomas Pollan, and two members of BraveNewCoin (Techemy Ltd),
											a New Zealand limited company registered under the number 5027000 in the Companies Office of New Zealand with registered office in 14-16 Maidstone St,
											Ponsonby, New Zealand, acting as escrow agent (<strong>BraveNewCoin</strong>), represented by Fran Strajnar and Pantelis Roussakis.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											Purchasers should note that BraveNewCoin’s role as escrow agent shall be limited to oversee the settlement of the token sale and the proper allocation of the MyB to the purchasers participating in the offer. Once the token sale is completed, the Escrow agent shall release the funds from the Multisig Escrow Wallet to a wallet with multi-signature of the MyBit Foundation <strong>(Multisig Foundation Wallet</strong>) under control of the (currently intended three) members of Seller’s board of trustees, in particular Ian Worrall, Thomas Pollan and Albin Bennett. Ian Worrall and Thomas Pollan form part of the developer team of the MyBit Platform, while Albin Bennett’s tasks are limited to serve as a member of the Seller’s board of trustees and of MyBit Ltd. The board of trustees of the Seller will be in charge of overseeing the intended use of funds, e.g. to transfer all required amounts to settle the costs of the My Bit Token Sale (in particular, but limited to escrow fees, establishment costs of the Seller and MyBit Ltd, legal fees, marketing costs, etc.) and release of the required funds to MyBit Ltd  to ensure that the Ether received as consideration by the Seller are used in order to develop the MyBit Platform according to milestones defined by the board of trustees of the Seller.

								<div className="heading">Previous MyBit Token Sale</div>
								<p>
									Purchasers should note that the Seller has offered to other selected purchasers to acquire MyB in exchange for up to 9,375 Ether (at a purchase price of 1 Ether per 133 MyB) prior and up to the commencement of the MyBit Token Sale set forth in Section 9 hereinafter (<strong>Previous MyBit Token Sale</strong>).
								</p>
								<p>
									As part of this, a pre-sale campaign was launched on 16 June 2017 on Chinese exchange “Dahonghuo” At this occasion, investors committed themselves to acquire MyB in exchange for 1,250 Ether. Dahonghuo is authorized to raise up to another two thousand seven hundred and fifty (2,750) Ether for MyB at such discounted rate up to the commencement of the MyBit Token Sale (as outlined in Section 9 hereinafter).

								<div className="heading">Certain Risks Associated with the Purchase of MyBit Tokens</div>
								<p>
									The purchase of MyB carries with it significant risk. Prior to purchasing MyB, the Purchaser should carefully consider the below risks and, to the extent necessary, consult a lawyer, accountant, and/or tax professionals prior to determining whether to purchase MyB.
								</p>
								<ol>
									<li>
										<p>
											<strong>
												Risk of Dissolution of The MyBit Project Due To a Diminishment in the Value of the Ether Sale Revenue
											</strong>
										</p>
										<p>
											All Purchasers are paying Ether to purchase MyB. It is possible that the value of Ether will drop significantly in the future, depriving the Seller of sufficient resources to continue to operate. In order to guard against this risk, the Seller might, at its sole discretion, periodically convert (partially, or in full, as the Seller may think fit) proceeds from the sale of MyB into fiat currencies instead of Ether.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											<strong>Risk of Losing Access to MyB Due to Loss of Wallet</strong>
										</p>
										<ol>
											<li>
												As noted above, MyB will be stored in a wallet, which can only be accessed with a password selected by the Purchaser. If a Purchaser of MyB does not maintain an accurate record of the Purchaser’s password or looses its wallet file, this will lead to the loss of MyB.
											</li>
											<li>
												As a result, Purchasers must safely store their password and the wallet file each in one or more backup locations that are well separated from the primary location. Additionally the password and the wallet should never be stored together.
											</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											<strong>Risk of Unauthorized Access to a Downloaded Wallet</strong>
										</p>
										<ol>
											<li>
												Any third party that gains access to the Purchaser’s wallet may potentially access the wallet by deciphering or cracking the Purchaser’s password. To guard against any improper access to the wallet, the Purchaser should select a highly secure password for the Purchaser’s MyB wallet.
											</li>
											<li>
												Purchaser must take care not to respond to any inquiry regarding their purchase of MyB, including but not limited to, email requests purportedly coming from the https://mybit.io or similar looking domain.
											</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											<strong>Risk of Regulatory Action in One or More Jurisdictions</strong>
										</p>
										<p>
											Cryptographic tokens and cryptocurrencies have been the subject of regulatory scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the globe. The MyBit Platform and MyB could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory action, which could impede or limit the ability of the Seller or the MyBit Parties to continue to develop the MyBit Platform.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											<strong>Risk of Alternative, Unofficial MyBit Networks</strong>
										</p>
										<p>
											Following the MyBit Token Sale, and the development of the initial version of the MyBit Platform, it is possible that alternative unofficial MyBit-based networks could be established, which utilize the same open source source code and open source protocol underlying the MyBit Platform. The official MyBit network may compete with these alternative, unofficial MyBit-based networks, which could potentially negatively impact the MyBit Platform and MyB. MyBit Parties may gain a competitive advantage being the party that developed the MyBit Platform, but such advantages are far from absolute.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											<strong>Risk of Insufficient Interest in the MyBit Platform or Distributed Applications</strong>
										</p>
										<p>
											It is possible that the MyBit Platform will not be used by a large number of external businesses, individuals, and other organizations and that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed applications. Such a lack of interest could impact the development of the MyBit Platform and potential uses of MyB. The Seller has contracted with developers to help build the MyBit Platform and is working with other third-party developers around the world to create an interest in the MyBit Platform. However, it cannot predict the success of its own development efforts or the efforts of other third parties.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											<strong>Risk Associated With the Development of Other Platforms For Decentralized Applications</strong>
										</p>
										<ol>
											<li>
												The Seller is one of several organizations, companies, and groups, attempting to build a platform which would facilitate the creation and deployment of decentralized applications. It is possible that different technical paradigms than the ones being used in the current MyBit Platform implementation are optimal.
											</li>
											<li>
												Competition from these alternative platforms for decentralized applications may impact success of the MyBit project and the ability of the Seller to operate and sell MyB in the future.
											</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											<strong>Risk that the MyBit Platform, As Developed, Will Not Meet the Expectations of potential clients</strong>
										</p>
										<p>
											The Purchaser recognizes that the MyBit Platform is presently under development and may undergo significant changes before release. Purchaser acknowledges that any expectations regarding the form and functionality of the MyBit Platform may not be met upon release of the MyBit Platform, for any number of reasons including a change in the design and implementation plans and execution of the implementation of the MyBit Platform.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											<strong>Risk that the MyBit Platform May Never be Completed or Released</strong>
										</p>
										<p>
											Purchaser understands that while the MyBit Team will make reasonable efforts to complete the MyBit software, it is possible that an official completed version of the MyBit Platform may not be released for technical or other reasons or that the functionality of the MyBit Platform is significantly limited due to bugs, technical flaws, lack of system integrity or other reasons and there may never be a partially or fully operational MyBit Platform.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											<strong>Risk of Theft</strong>
										</p>
										<ol>
											<li>
												Hackers or other groups or organizations may attempt to steal the Ether revenue from the MyBit Token Sale, thus potentially impacting the ability of the Seller to develop the MyBit Platform. To account for this risk, the Seller has and will continue to implement comprehensive security precautions to safeguard the Ether obtained from the sale of MyB.
											</li>
											<li>
												Multi-factor security measures will be taken to protect Ether and MyB including physical elements, Shamir’s Secret Sharing Algorithm, multi signature keys, BIP 32, anti-spear-phishing procedures, splitting of funds, hot/cold wallet partitioning and diversification. Moreover, regular security audits of hot and cold wallets will be conducted by internal and external teams.
											</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											<strong>Risk of Security Weaknesses in the MyBit Platform Core Infrastructure Software</strong>
										</p>
										<ol>
											<li>
												The MyBit Platform rests on open-source software, and there is a risk that the MyBit Team, or other third parties not directly affiliated with the MyBit Parties, may introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the MyBit Platform causing the system to lose MyB stored in one or more Purchaser accounts or other accounts or lose sums of other valued tokens issued on the MyBit Platform.
											</li>
											<li>
												The Seller has taken steps to build, maintain, and secure, to the extent possible, the infrastructure of the MyBit Platform, and will continue to do so after the MyBit Token Sale. For example, the Seller intends to hire external consultants on a periodic basis to assess and audit the security of the MyBit Platform and will work with cryptography and security experts to develop and employ best practices to audit the Platform.
											</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											<strong>Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography</strong>
										</p>
										<ol>
											<li>
												Cryptography is an art, not a science. And the state of the art can advance over time advances in code cracking, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the MyBit Platform, which could result in the theft or loss of MyB.
											</li>
											<li>
												To the extent possible, the Seller intends to update the protocol underlying the MyBit Platform to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but cannot it cannot predict the future of cryptography or the success of any future security updates.
											</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											<strong>Risk of Rapid Adoption and Increased Demand for MyBit Tokens</strong>
										</p>
										<p>
											If the MyBit Platform is rapidly adopted, the demand for MyB could rise dramatically. Under such a scenario, the entire MyBit Platform could become destabilized, due to the increased cost of running distributed applications. In turn, this could dampen interest in the MyBit Project and MyB.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											<strong>Risks associated with the Ethereum protocol</strong>
										</p>
										<p>
											MyB and the MyBit Platform are based upon the Ethereum protocol. As such, any malfunction, breakdown, abandonment, unintended function or unexpected functioning of the Ethereum protocol may have a material adverse effect on the MyBit Platform and/or MyB.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											<strong>Risk of Need of Additional Liquidity or Capital</strong>
										</p>
										<p>
											The MyB offering may not be completed for various reasons and/or might be terminated which may lead to a shortage of available financial means for the MyBit Project, the MyBit Foundation and/or the MyBit Platform. In addition, the MyBit Project, the MyBit Foundation and/or the MyBit Platform may need additional liquidity and/or capital in the future which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											<strong>Risk of Additional Competition </strong>
										</p>
										<p>
											The markets in which the MyBit Platform intends to operate are highly competitive and some of its potential future competitors may have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing or development resources than the MyBit Platform and, in some cases, greater name recognition, more experience or better customer reach.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											<strong>Risk of Regulatory Changes/Violations of Law and Regulations</strong>
										</p>
										<p>
											Changes in applicable laws and regulations in various jurisdictions, violations of such laws and regulations or future changes could cause the MyBit Project to incur significant costs and adversely affect its development and/or operations. Further, the MyBit Project, the MyBit Foundation and/or the MyBit Platform may be subject to unexpected tax burdens which could cause the MyBit Project to incur significant additional costs and adversely affect its development and/or operations or its attractiveness to future customers or users.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											<strong>Risks Relating to Technologies Employed</strong>
										</p>
										<p>
											The technologies employed by the MyBit Platform are still evolving and the MyBit Platform may face unexpected challenges in the development, deployment and operation of its service offerings. Further, the operations the MyBit Platform will rely on complex IT systems and networks, which can be susceptible to malfunctions and interruptions. The MyBit Project will use open source software that may subject its products and services to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what it believes to be open source software or source code release requirements. Changes to data protection laws and regulations and their interpretation may impact the development and operations of its services. The growth of its business and potential revenue, if any, will depend on the uncertain development of new markets for newly developed products, solutions and services, which are still evolving, and it is uncertain whether its products and solutions will achieve and/or sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											<strong>Risks Relating to Adverse Publicity, Reputation and Regulatory Inquiries</strong>
										</p>
										<p>
											Adverse publicity about, political opposition to, reputational issues relating to, or regulatory inquiries into, blockchain technology, crypto fuels and/or token sales could inhibit the growth of the overall market in general and the MyBit Project in particular.
