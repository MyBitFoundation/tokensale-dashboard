        					The following Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern the sale of cryptographic tokens -- MyB Tokens (“MyB”) -- that is required to transact on the MyBit open source software platform (“MyBit Platform”) to purchasers of MyB (“Purchasers” collectively, and “Purchaser” individually).

        					<strong>
        						This document is not a solicitation for investment and does not pertain in any way to an offering of securities in any jurisdiction. As described further below, transactions on the MyBit Platform may require payments of a token in order to create transactions. Without payment for operations, the system may become vulnerable to attack, and thus would not be viable, and would grind to a halt. The payments, in the form of block rewards and transaction fees, are made to owners of computational resources (miners) in exchange for securing the MyBit Platform’s network and for transmitting transactions. This document describes the initial sale in which the token (MyB) is sold, as well as the perpetual coordinated spontaneous creation of the “MyB Tokens.” Parties may be interested in purchasing MyB in the initial sale to support the development of the MyBit Platform, and to prepare for their eventual use of the MyBit Platform when it is launched. Individuals, businesses, and other organizations should carefully weigh the risks, costs, and benefits of acquiring MyB early in the initial sale versus waiting to purchase MyB on open, third-party exchanges once the system is operational and when they or their businesses actually require MyB to operate.

        				<p>
        					<strong className="upper">IMPORTANT</strong>
        				</p>
        				<p>
        					Ownership of MyB carries no rights express or implied. Purchases of MyB are non-refundable. Purchasers should have no expectation of influence over governance of the platform. By participating in the sale of MyB, you expressly acknowledge and represent that you have carefully reviewed the Terms and fully understand the risks, costs, and benefits of purchasing MyB and agree to be bound by these Terms. As set forth below, you further represent and warrant that, to the extent permitted by law, you are authorized to purchase MyB in your relevant jurisdiction, are of a legal age to be bound by these Terms, and will not hold MyB, its parent and affiliates, and the officers, directors, agents, joint ventures, employees and suppliers of MYBIT or our parent or affiliates, now or in the future and any other member of the MyBit Team (collectively the “MYBIT Parties”) liable for any losses or any special, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of, or in any way connected to the sale of MyB.
        				</p>
        				<p>
        					<strong>
        						WARNING: DO NOT PURCHASE MyB IF YOU ARE NOT AN EXPERT IN DEALING WITH CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS AND BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SOFTWARE SYSTEMS
        					</strong>
        				</p>
        				<p>
        					Purchases of MyB should be undertaken only by individuals, entities, or companies that have significant experience with, and understanding of, the usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens, like bitcoin (“BTC”), and blockchain-based software systems. Purchasers should have functional understanding of storage and transmission mechanisms associated with other cryptographic tokens. While the MyBit Team will be available to assist Purchasers of MyB during and after the sale, MYBIT will not be responsible for lost BTC or MyB resulting from actions taken by, or omitted by Purchasers. Note, in particular, that MyB Purchasers should take great care to write down their wallet password and not lose it so as to be sure that they will be able to access their MyB when it becomes available after the initial sale. If you do not have such experience or expertise, then you should not purchase MyB or participate in the pre-sale of MyB.
        				</p>
        				<p>
        					<strong>WARNING: CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS MAY EXPERIENCE EXTREME PRICE VOLATILITY</strong>
        				</p>
        				<p>
        					Cryptographic tokens that possess value in public markets, such as BTC, have demonstrated extreme fluctuations in price over short periods of time on a regular basis. A Purchaser of MyB should be prepared to expect similar fluctuations, both down and up, in the price of MyB denominated in BTC, ETH, United States dollars (“USD”), or currencies of other such jurisdictions. Such fluctuations are due to market forces and represent changes in the balance of supply and demand. MYBIT cannot and does not guarantee market liquidity for MyB and therefore there may be periods of time in which MyB is difficult to buy. Additionally, due to different regulatory dictates in different jurisdictions and the inability of citizens of certain countries to open accounts at exchanges located anywhere in the world, the liquidity of MyB may be markedly different in different countries and this would likely be reflected in significant price discrepancies. By purchasing MyB, you expressly acknowledge and represent that you fully understand that MyB may experience volatility in pricing and will not seek to hold any of the MYBIT Parties liable for any losses or any special, incidental, or consequential damages arising from, or in any way connected to, the sale of MyB.
        				</p>
        				<p>
        					<strong>WARNING: THE PURCHASE OF MyB HAS A NUMBER OF RISKS</strong>
        				</p>
        				<p>
        					The purchase of MyB carries with it a number of risks. Prior to purchasing MyB, you should carefully consider the risks listed below and, to the extent necessary, consult an appropriate lawyer, accountant, or tax professional. If any of the following risks are unacceptable to you, you should not purchase MyB. By purchasing MyB, and to the extent permitted by law, you are agreeing not to hold any of the MYBIT Parties liable for any losses or any special, incidental, or consequential damages arising from, or in any way connected, to the sale of MyB, including losses associated with the risks set forth below.

        						<div className="info">
                                    The MyBit Platform requires, for proper operation, and comprehensive utilization, a cryptographic token called MyB Tokens (“MyB”). MYBIT will produce and market a quantity of MyB in a pre-sale event called the initial sale, to be conducted on its web site at https://MyBit.io (“the initial sale”). Purchasers in the initial sale will acquire MyB in exchange for BTC, ETH, ETC, and various additional cryptocurrencies at predefined sale prices over a period of thirty (30) days. Purchasers of MyB in the initial sale will be granted user accounts on the aforementioned website that will enable them to claim their purchase once the product has been developed and is ready for delivery. All MyB pre-sold in this manner will be created in the MyBit Platform’s initial Block -- the initial block of the MyBit Platform’s blockchain -- which constitutes the inception of operation of the system which is expected to be created during the first quarter of 2017, although there are no guarantees that this will occur according to such a time -frame or at all. After such time, MYBIT will allocate the purchased MyB to the corresponding user account on the web site, delivering it to their control.

        							MyB will be created through two processes: (1) a pre-mining process, at the instant the system becomes operational, that will create and place a sum of one-million (1,000,000) MyB in the initial block of the blockchain used for the MyBit Platform, and (2) the ongoing mining process which secures the MyBit blockchain. The mining process will create fifty (50) MyB per block with the amount halving every 210,000 blocks. The initial sale is directly related only to the first process. Any unsold MyB from the initial block shall remain in the control of MYBIT and to be used at the discretion of MYBIT management.

        							<ol className="sub">
        								<li className="info">
        									It is possible that the value of BTC, Ethereum, or other held cryptocurrency will drop significantly in the future, depriving MYBIT of sufficient resources to continue to operate. In order to guard against this risk, MYBIT intends to periodically convert proceeds from the sale of MyB into US dollars and/or Euro instead of BTC, Ethereum, or other cryptocurrency.
        								</li>
        								<li className="info">
        									As noted above, MyB will be stored in a wallet, which can only be accessed with a password selected by
        									the Purchaser. If a Purchaser of MyB does not maintain an accurate record of their password, this may lead to the loss of MyB. As a result, Purchasers must safely store their password in one or more backup locations that are well separated from the primary location. In order to access one’s MyB the password that the Purchaser entered is requiredb loss of this may lead to the loss of a Purchaser’s MyB.
        								</li>
        								<li className="info">
        									Any third party that gains access to the Purchaser’s Purchase Email may be able to gain access to the
        									Purchaser’s account on the MYBIT web wallet. Purchaser must take care not to respond to any inquiry regarding their purchase of MyB, including but not limited to, email requests purportedly coming from the MyBit.io or similar looking
        									domain.
        								</li>
        								<li className="info">
        									Cryptocurrencies have been the subject of regulatory scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the globe.
        									The MyBit Platform and MYBIT could be impacted by one or more regulatory enquiries or regulatory action, which could impede or limit the ability of MYBIT to continue to develop the MyBit Platform.
        								</li>
        								<li className="info">
        									Following the initial sale, and the development of the initial version of the MyBit Protocol and web wallet application (i.e., version 1.0), it is possible that alternative unofficial MyBit-based networks could be established, which utilize the same open source source code and open source protocol underlying The MyBit Platform. The official MyBit Platform may compete with these alternative, unofficial MyBit-based networks, which could potentially negatively impact the MyBit Platform and MYBIT. MYBIT may gain a competitive advantage being the party that developed the MyBit Platform, but such advantages are far from absolute.
        								</li>
        								<li className="info">
        									It is possible that the MyBit Platform will not be used by a large number of external businesses, individuals, and other organizations and that there will be limited public interest in the peer-to-peer management of assets on the Blockchain. Such a lack of interest could impact the development of the MyBit Platform and potential uses of MyB. MYBIT has contracted with developers to help build the MyBit Platform and is working with other third-parties around the world to create an interest in the MyBit Platform. However, it cannot predict the success of its own development efforts or the efforts of other third parties.
        								</li>
        								<li className="info">
        									The Purchaser recognizes that the MyBit Platform is currently under development and may undergo significant changes before release. Purchaser acknowledges that any expectations regarding the form and functionality of the MyBit Platform held by the Purchaser may not be met upon release of the MyBit Platform, for any number of reasons including a change in the design and implementation plans and execution of the implementation of the MyBit Platform.
        								</li>
        								<li className="info">
        									Purchaser understands, that while the MyBit Team will make reasonable efforts to complete the MyBit software, it is possible that an official completed version of the MyBit Platform may not be released and there may never be an operational MyBit Platform.

        								<li className="info">
        									Hackers or other groups or organizations may attempt to steal the BTC, Ethereum, or other cryptocurrency revenue from the initial sale, thus potentially impacting the ability of MYBIT to develop the MyBit Platform and operate MyB. To account for this risk, MYBIT has and will continue to implement comprehensive security precautions to safeguard the cryptocurrencies obtained from the sale of MyB. Multi-factor security measures will be taken to protect cryptocurrencies and MyB including, but not limited to, physical elements, multisignature keys, BIP 32, anti-spear-phishing procedures, splitting of funds, hot-cold wallet partitioning and diversification. Moreover, regular security audits of hot and cold wallets will be conducted by internal and external teams.
        								</li>
        								<li className="info">
        									The MyBit Platform rests on open-source software, and there is a risk that the MyBit Team, or other third parties not directly affiliated with the MYBIT Parties, may introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the MyBit Platform causing the system to lose MyB stored in one or more Purchaser accounts or other accounts or lose sums of other valued tokens issued on the MyBit Platform. MYBIT has taken steps to build, maintain, and secure the infrastructure of the MyBit Platform, and will continue to do so after the initial sale. For example, MYBIT intends to hire external consultants on a periodic basis to assess and audit the security of the MyBit Platform and will work with cryptography and security experts to develop and employ best practices to audit the Platform.
        								</li>
        								<li className="info">
        									Advances in code cracking, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present
        									risks to cryptocurrencies and the MyBit Platform, which could result in the theft or loss of MyB . T o the extent possible,
        									MYBIT intends to update the protocol underlying the MyBit Platform to account for any advances in cryptography and
        									to incorporate additional security measures, but cannot it cannot predict the future of cryptography or the success of
        									any future security updates.
        								</li>
        								<li className="info">
        									As with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the MyBit Platform is susceptible to mining attacks,
        									including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and race
        									condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the MyBit Platform, expected proper execution and
        									sequencing of MyB transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations.
        								</li>
        								<li className="info">
        									The loss or destruction of a private key by MYBIT, issuer or investor required to access an MyBit may be
        									irreversible. MYBIT’s loss of access to its private keys or a data loss relating to MYBIT’s, issuer’s or investor’s
        									MYBIT could adversely affect the value of MyB.
        								</li>
        								<li className="info">
        									MYBIT is a new product, thus contributing to price volatility that could adversely affect the value of MyB. The factors
        									affecting the further development of the digital assets industry, as well as the MyBit Platform, include:
        									<ol className="sub-sub">
        										<li className="info">continued worldwide growth in the adoption and use of MyB and other digital assets</li>
        										<li className="info">
        											government and quasi-government regulation of MyB Tokens and other digital assets and their use, or
        											restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of the MyBit Platform or similar digital asset systems
        										</li>
        										<li className="info">the maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of the MyBit Platform</li>
        										<li className="info">changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences</li>
        										<li className="info">the availability and popularity of other similar products and</li>
        										<li className="info">general economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to the MyBit Platform and digital assets.</li>
        									</ol>
        								</li>
        								<li className="info">
        									Amendments to the MyBit Platform’s protocols and software, if accepted and authorized by the MyBit Platform’s community, could adversely affect MyB Tokens. The MyBit Platform is based on a math-based protocol that governs the peer-to-peer interactions between computers connected to the MyBit Platform. To the extent that a significant majority of the users on the MyBit Platform install software upgrade(s), the MyBit Platform would be subject to new protocols and software that may adversely affect MyB Tokens. If more than a significant majority of the users and miners on the MyBit Platform install such software upgrade(s), the MyBit Platform could “fork.”
        								</li>
        								<li className="info">
        									A failure to properly monitor and upgrade the protocol could damage the MyBit Platform and an MyB.
        								</li>
        								<li className="info">
        									Intellectual property rights claims may adversely affect the operation of the MyBit Platform. Third parties may assert intellectual property claims relating to the holding and transfer of digital assets and their source code. Regardless of the merit of any intellectual property or other legal action, any threatened action that reduces confidence in the MyBit Platform’s long term viability or the ability of end-users to hold and transfer MyB may adversely affect the value of MyB. Additionally, a meritorious intellectual property claim could prevent MYBIT and other end-users from accessing the MyBit Platform or holding or transferring their MyB Tokens.
        								</li>
        								<li className="info">
        									Cryptocurrency exchanges on which MyB may trade may be relatively new and largely unregulated and may therefore be more exposed to fraud and failure than established, regulated exchanges for other products. To the extent that the cryptocurrency exchanges representing a substantial portion of the volume in MyBit trading are involved in fraud or experience security failures or other operational issues, such cryptocurrency exchange failures may result in a reduction in the price and can adversely affect the value of MyB. A lack of stability in the cryptocurrency exchanges and the closure or temporary shutdown of cryptocurrency exchanges due to fraud, business failure, hackers or malware, or government-mandated regulation may reduce confidence in the MyBit Platform and result in greater volatility in the price.
        								</li>
        								<li className="info">
        									Political or economic crises may motivate large-scale sales of MyB, which could result in a reduction in the price and adversely affect the value of an MyB. digital assets such as MyB, which are relatively new, are subject to supply and demand forces based upon the desirability of an alternative, decentralized means of transacting, and it is unclear how such supply and demand will be impacted by geopolitical events. Large-scale sales of MyB would result in a reduction in the price and adversely affect the value of an MyB.
        								</li>
        								<li className="info">
        									It is possible that a digital asset other than MyB could have features that make it more desirable to a material portion of the digital asset user base, resulting in a reduction in demand for an MyB, which could have a negative impact on the use and price of MyB. It is possible that a comparable product could become materially popular due to either a perceived or exposed shortcoming of the MyBit Platform that is not immediately addressed by the MyBit Team, or a perceived advantage of a comparable product that includes features not incorporated into MyB. If this product obtains significant market share, it could have a negative impact on the demand for, and price of, an MyB.
        								</li>
        								<li className="info">
        									MyB transactions are irrevocable and stolen or incorrectly transferred MyB Tokens may be irretrievable. As a result, any incorrectly executed MyB transactions could adversely affect the value of an MyB. MyB transactions are not, from an administrative perspective, reversible without the consent and active participation of the recipient of the transaction or, in theory, control or consent of a majority of the processing power on the MyBit Platform. Once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to the blockchain, an incorrect transfer of MyB Tokens or a theft of MyB generally will not be reversible and there may be no compensation for any such transfer or theft. Such loss could adversely affect the value of an MyB.
        								</li>
        								<li className="info">
        									MYBIT may not have adequate sources of recovery if MyBs are lost, stolen or destroyed. If MyB's or issuer's MyBs are lost, stolen or destroyed under circumstances rendering a party liable to MYBIT or issuer, the responsible party may not have the financial resources sufficient to satisfy the claim.
